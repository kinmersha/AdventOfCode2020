Advent of code challenges (see: https://adventofcode.com/2020/)

I'm writing these in Python as a general refresher to myself since I've written far too much Matlab at work lately :(

Trying to write things nicely rather than strive for absolutely maximal efficiency or minimum lines of code. Want to practice writing nice code for when I do it for work again or whatever. Same reason I'm leaving some comments to my future self, or any friends I show my code to.
